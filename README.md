# Simple LMS API

A Node.js and Express API for the Simple LMS project

## Getting Started

Simply clone this repo and then in the directory of the project run the following commands to install node dependencies.

	npm install

Once the installation is complete, simply run the following command to start your server.

	gulp serve

This will start up the node application on port 3000. Simply visit [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) to see the Hello World JSON response. While using `gulp serve` any changes you make to the files will automatically reload the server.

## Docker
